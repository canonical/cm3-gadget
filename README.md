# Raspberry CM3 Gadget Snap

This repository contains the source for an official Ubuntu Core gadget snap
for the Raspberry CM3.

Building it with snapcraft will automatically pull, configure, patch and build
the git.denx.de/u-boot.git upstream source for rpi_3_32b_defconfig at
release v2017.05, produce a u-boot.bin binary and put it inside the gadget.

It will then download the latest stable binary boot firmware
from https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/tree/stable/boot and add it to the gadget.

Last it will pull the latest linux-image-raspi2 from the xenial-updates archive, extract the
devicetree and overlay files from it and add them to the gadget as well.

We use Launchpad to track issues as this allows us to coordinate multiple
projects better than what is available with Github issues.
